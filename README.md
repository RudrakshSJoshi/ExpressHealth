## Problem Statement


In the current landscape of healthcare, there exists a significant gap in the provision of a unified platform that seamlessly integrates medical data for diagnostics, research and patient engagement. This deficiency in available systems leads to challenges in delivering timely and precise diagnoses, ultimately depriving patients of immediate access to critical healthcare insights. Additionally, healthcare professionals and researchers encounter obstacles in accessing diverse medical data necessary for analytical studies and pattern analysis, thereby impeding progress in medical research. 
Moreover, prevailing healthcare systems often lack interoperability, resulting in the fragmentation of patient data across various providers and institutions. This fragmentation not only disrupts the continuity of care but also restricts the ability of healthcare professionals to make well-informed decisions based on a comprehensive patient history.
